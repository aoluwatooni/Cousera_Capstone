This project seeks to find how similar Italy and Nigeria are and the factors that were responsible for the high rate of infection and deaths in Italy. The degree of similarity will allow us to predict the rate of spread in Nigeria since it\u2019ll follow the pattern of spread in Italy.\nOur business problem asks the following questions.\n1.\tHow similar are neighborhoods in Italy and Nigeria?\n2.\tWhat\u2019s the current infection rate per million persons in both countries?\n3.\tWhat factors contributed to the high rate of infection of COVID-19 in Italy?\n4.\tWhat interventions did Italy do to slow down the rate of infection?\n5.\tWill the same interventions work for Nigeria?
